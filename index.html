No matter how complicated or how challenging the environment , he was always able to maintain a clarity about where our efforts should be focused and directed next.
I couldn't have asked for a better mentor and I am deeply grateful to Khandekar Sir not only for all his professional guidance but even more so for the immense love and deep friendship that he personally extended to me.
